✨ About the Project
This website was created as a way to bring together the people we love, even if they can’t be physically present at our wedding.

The main idea is to provide a live stream of our special day, creating a cozy and interactive environment for everyone watching from a distance.

Along the way, I also took the opportunity to challenge myself technically and explore clean architecture and design patterns.

📐 Architecture
Based on the MVC pattern:

Controllers: Handle all logic and behavior.

Views/Components: Focused on screen rendering only.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Tool	Purpose
React.JS	UI library
Phosphor Icons	Icon library
Date-fns	Lightweight date manipulation
Styled-components	CSS-in-JS styling
💡 All design elements and animations were crafted from scratch without any UI libraries, as a personal CSS challenge.
